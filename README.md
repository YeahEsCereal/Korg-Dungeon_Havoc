# HOW TO PLAY ON THIS SITE
Exploring and shopping are modes. Press Explore to start. Then, scroll to the dice where you roll. (The dice face is displayed as a number). The rest will happen automatically.

# EXTRA
If you got damaged from a Pit Trap (for example), you have a chance to use a rope (if you had one). The rope will undo the damage. The chance ends when you press the Shop or Explore button.
The number next to the current encounter is its "X" value.
